T(ic) T(ac) T(oe) Web Interface
===============================

This is a command line interface to my [Java TTT lib](https://github.com/JoshCheek/java-ttt-library). It uses a [web server]() I wrote. I created it as a practice assignment during my residency at [8th Light](http://www.8thlight.com/).
